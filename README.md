# Data Structures
> Projects of data structures class

## Overview
1. Project 1: A C++ program solving a finding peak problem.
2. Project 2: A C++ program solving an optimal path problem.
3. Project 3: An AI player playing an instructor-designed board game.

## Reflections
* All projects were maintained with version control.
  Unfortunately, I didn't know about `git push` then, so all commits were lost after folder rearrangements.
  But I realised the importance of code maintanence during project developments.
* Project 1 is the first time I have encountered problems with no _correct_ answer.
  It forced me to come up with original solutions and give up searching for the be-all algorithm.
